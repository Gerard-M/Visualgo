# Visualgo

# I. Project Overview
Visualgo is a web-based application that aims to help other algo-ers in algorithm visualization. Our app holds a user authentication, built to store the user input history. And the main feature is the simulation of algorithms; **Sorting Algorithm Simulation** allows bar dragging for interactivity, user input, algorithm and speed choices, pause and play, **Binary Search Tree Simulation** allows user inout for adding and removing nodes, and **Data Structure Visualizer** allows users to push/queue based on input and pop/dequeue.

# II. System Architecture
Provide a high-level overview of the system architecture, including
key components and their interactions.

# III. Applied Computer Science Concept
*Sorting Algorithms* <br>
*Binary Search Tree* <br>
*Stack and Queue* 

# IV. Algorithms Used
Discuss the algorithms implemented in the project, how they work,
and how they are applied.

# V. Security Mechanisms
Discuss the security measures implemented in the project.

# VI. Development Process and Design Decisions
