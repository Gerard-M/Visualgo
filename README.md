# Visualgo

## I. Project Overview
Visualgo is a web-based application designed to help users understand computer science concepts through interactive algorithm visualization. It supports simulation of **Sorting Algorithms**, **Binary Search Trees**, and **Data Structure Visualizations** like stacks and queues. Features include:

- **Sorting Algorithm Simulation**: Drag-and-drop interactivity, user input options, algorithm and speed selection, pause/play functionality.
- **Binary Search Tree Simulation**: Interactive node addition and removal.
- **Data Structure Visualizer**: Allows users to push/queue and pop/dequeue elements dynamically.

This application provides an educational platform aimed at enhancing comprehension of algorithmic processes.

## II. System Architecture
The application follows a client-server model with key components:
- **Frontend**: A responsive and interactive user interface built with modern web technologies for visualization.
- **Backend**: Implements algorithm logic, API endpoints, and user authentication features.
- **Database**: Stores user data, including input history and account details.

## III. Applied Computer Science Concepts
- Sorting Algorithms
- Binary Search Tree Operations
- Stack and Queue Management

## IV. Algorithms Used
This project implements foundational algorithms:
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort)
- Binary Search Tree operations (insertion, deletion)
- Stack and Queue operations (push, pop, enqueue, dequeue)

Each algorithm is optimized for clarity and educational value.

## V. Security Mechanisms
Robust security measures include:
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks.
- Secure user authentication and data handling with Firebase.
- Data encryption using CryptoJS.

## VI. Development Process and Design Decisions
- **User-centric Design**: Intuitive, interactive visualizations for better user engagement.
- **Modular Codebase**: Separate layers for UI, business logic, and data storage ensure maintainability.
- **Performance Optimization**: Preemptive testing for scalability and responsiveness across devices.

## VII. Correctness and Efficiency
Correctness and efficiency are ensured through:
- Rigorous testing for all algorithms using diverse datasets.
- Feedback loops during development to refine UI and logic.

## VIII. How to Run the Project
1. Create an account or log in to the system.
2. Navigate to the main dashboard and select an algorithm simulation.
3. Interact with the selected feature through the provided interface.
