# Visualgo

# I. Project Overview
Visualgo is a web-based application that aims to help other algo-ers in algorithm visualization. Our app holds a user authentication, built to store the user input history. And the main feature is the simulation of algorithms; **Sorting Algorithm Simulation** allows bar dragging for interactivity, user input, algorithm and speed choices, pause and play, **Binary Search Tree Simulation** allows user inout for adding and removing nodes, and **Data Structure Visualizer** allows users to push/queue based on input and pop/dequeue.

# II. System Architecture
Provide a high-level overview of the system architecture, including
key components and their interactions.

# III. Applied Computer Science Concept
